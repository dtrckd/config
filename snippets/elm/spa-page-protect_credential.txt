iI would ask #general or #beginners if they have any recommendations for tokens/authentication in an elm app.
You should be able to apply that general idea to elm-spa, because the latest version is just focused on pages + routing.
When in comes to protecting a certain route, i'd create a file at src/Utils.elm that exposes a function like this:
protected
  : ( User
                -> Global.Model
                      -> flags
                            -> ( Maybe model, Cmd msg, Cmd Global.Msg)
                                )
    -> Global.Model
      -> flags
        -> ( Maybe model, Cmd msg, Cmd Global.Msg )
    protected pageInit global flags =
      case global.user of
          Just user ->
                pageInit user global flags
                    Nothing ->
                          ( Nothing
                                  , Cmd.none
                                        , Global.navigate Route.SignIn
                                              )
    Then, in your page files, you can call component like this:
    module Pages.Example
    import Utils exposing (protected)
    type alias Model =
      Maybe Model_
      type alias Model_ =
        -- your actual model
        page : Page Flags Model Msg
        page =
          Page.component
              { init = protected init
                      , update = update
                              , subscriptions = subscriptions
                                  , view = view
                                      }
init
  : User
    -> Global
      -> Flags
        -> ( Model, Cmd Msg, Cmd Global.Msg )
    init user global flags =
      -- normal init things here + guaranteed
        -- access to the user!
